      <h1>Game Rules</h1>
  
      <h5>Goal of the game</h5>
      <div>
        In the classic UNO game, the goal is to be the first player to score 500
        points. Each round, the player earns points by being the first to play
        all their cards from their hand. Points are awarded for all the cards
        remaining in the hands of the other players.
      </div>
      <br />

      <h5>Game preparation</h5>
      <div>
        The cards are shuffled, and each player is dealt 7 cards, which they
        take into their hand. The remaining cards are placed face down in the
        middle to form the draw pile. The top card from the draw pile is turned
        over and placed next to it. This stack becomes the discard pile. A
        player is randomly selected to start the round.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h5>Progression of the game</h5>
      <div>
        The first player places a card from their hand on the discard pile. The
        rule is: a card can only be placed on a card of the same color or the
        same number. The black cards are special action cards with specific
        rules (see Action Cards). If a player cannot play a matching card, they
        must draw a penalty card from the face-down pile. They can immediately
        play this card if it matches. If they don't have a matching card, the
        next player takes their turn. When a player has only one card left, they
        must say "UNO!" (which means "One") to signal that they have only one
        card left in their hand. If a player forgets to do this and another
        player notices before the next player draws or discards a card, the
        forgetful player must draw 1 penalty card. The round is won by the
        player who plays the last card. The points are tallied, and a new round
        is played.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h5>Action Cards</h5>
      <div>
        In the game, there are black action cards with different functions,
        which are explained below.
      </div>
      <h4>Draw Two Cards</h4>
      <div>
        When this card is played, the next player must draw 2 cards and is not
        allowed to play any cards during their turn. This card can only be
        placed on a card of the corresponding color or on another "Draw Two
        Cards". If it's the first card played at the beginning of the game, the
        same rules apply.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h4>Reverse Card</h4>
      <div>
        When this card is played, the direction of play changes. If the game was
        previously going clockwise, it will now go counterclockwise, and vice
        versa. This card can only be placed on a card of the corresponding color
        or on another Reverse Card. If this card is drawn at the beginning of
        the game, the dealer starts, and then the player to their right
        continues the game instead of the player to their left.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h4>Skip Card</h4>
      <div>
        After this card is played, the next player is "skipped," meaning they
        lose their turn. This card can only be placed on a card of the same
        color or on another Skip Card. If this card is drawn at the beginning of
        the game, the player to the left of the dealer is "skipped," and the
        player to the left of that player continues the game.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h4>Wild Card</h4>
      <div>
        The player who plays this card gets to decide which color should be
        played next. They can even choose the same color that is already in
        play. A Wild Card can also be played when the player has another legal
        card to play. If a Wild Card is drawn at the beginning of the game, the
        player to the left of the dealer gets to choose the color for the next
        play.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h4>Wild Draw Four Card</h4>
      <div>
        This card is the most powerful one. The player who plays it gets to
        choose the color that continues the game, and the next player must draw
        4 cards from the draw pile and forfeit their turn. Unfortunately, this
        card can only be played if the player holding it doesn't have a card in
        their hand that matches the color and value on the discard pile. Also, this
        card may not be played on top of another +4 Card or a wildcard. If
        this card is drawn at the beginning of the game, it should be returned
        to the pile, and another card should be drawn.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h4>Penalty Cards</h4>
      <div>
        When a player does not follow the rules, they must draw one or more
        penalty cards. The penalty rules are as follows:

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
          <li>
            In UNO, if a player forgets to call "UNO!" after playing their
            second-to-last card and the next player has not yet played a card,
            they must draw two penalty cards. This is to encourage players to
            announce "UNO!" when they have only one card left to prevent others
            from catching the mistake.
          </li>
          <li>
            In UNO, if a player plays a card when it's not their turn or plays
            the wrong card, they must take the card back and draw an additional
            penalty card. This rule is in place to ensure that players take
            their turns in the correct order and play valid cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            In UNO, the +4 card can only be played when a player cannot follow
            the current color, except for other action cards. If the player
            targeted by the +4 card believes it was played incorrectly, they can
            challenge the previous player. The previous player must then prove
            that they couldn't correctly follow the color by showing their
            cards. If they can confirm this, the challenging player must draw 6
            cards instead of the usual 4. However, if the previous player is
            found to have played the +4 card incorrectly, they themselves must
            draw the 4 cards as a penalty. This rule is in place to prevent the
            abuse of the +4 card.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br />
      <h5>Points</h5>
      <div>
        The player who is the first to discard all their cards receives the
        following points for the cards still held by their fellow players:
      </div>
      <br />
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>All numbered cards:</td>
          <td>Value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Draw Two cards</td>
          <td>20 Points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Reverse card</td>
          <td>20 Points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Skip Card</td>
          <td>20 Points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Wild Card</td>
          <td>50 Points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Wild Draw Four cards</td>
          <td>50 Points</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br />
      <div>
        The player who reaches 500 points first wins the game. In addition to
        the standard rules of UNO, there are many modifications and variants.
      </div>
    </div>
